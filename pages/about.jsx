            <p>
                Started my journey what feels like a lifetime ago, but
                really it was only a few years. I{'\''}ve been working with
                computers since I was a kid, but I didn{'\''}t really get into
                programming until I was in my 20s. I started with Python and
                quickly fell in love with the logic and problem-solving aspects
                of coding. Since then, I{'\''}ve learned a variety of languages
                and frameworks, including JavaScript, React, and Next.js.

                I love to travel and explore new places. I{'\''}ve been to several
                countries and have met some amazing people along the way. I
                enjoy riding my motorcycle on nice days and gaming or watching movies 
                other days. I also love to learn new things. I{'\''}m always looking for new
                challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

                Joining the Marine Corps was a pivotal moment in my life. It taught me
                discipline, leadership, and the importance of teamwork. I
                served for five years, and during that time, I
                developed a strong sense of duty and responsibility. These
                values have shaped who I am today and continue to influence my
                work ethic and approach to problem-solving. I continue to meet incredible 
                individuals from the community and it has provided me with opportunities
                I couldn{'\''}t have imagined. I am grateful for the experiences and
                lessons I{'\''}ve learned along the way.
